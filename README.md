# dice-game

I used HTML to code the structure of the webpage.
I used CSS to style it.
And I used JS to code the game. 

Pain Points: 
- Learning to use JavaScript, a language that I have a little experience in, to write code that actively interacted with the user.
- Learning what DOMs were.

How I overcame these:
- Watching YouTube tutorials, and also using StackOverflow for specific questions.
